    "Unique Output for Each Input:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: In a function, each input is associated with exactly one output. This means that for any given input value, there is only one corresponding output value.\n",
    "Implication: An input cannot produce multiple outputs. If you input a specific value into the function, you'll always get the same result.\n",
    "Different Inputs Can Share the Same Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: While each input has a unique output, different inputs can produce the same output. This means that two or more distinct input values can map to the same output value.\n",
    "Implication: The function can assign the same output to multiple inputs without violating its definition.\n",
